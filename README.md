#Quest Log#

A quest tracker for your everyday life.

This is an idea I've been playing with for a while now, and I figure it's
finally time to start building it in software.


##Usage##

Don't use it (yet).

I'll put more useful info here later.


##Background##

I built the pen-and-paper "prototype" for this in high school to manage my ADHD
tendencies. It's changed a lot over the years, but I still use the same basic
workflow to this day.

I've toyed with the idea of writing software to streamline this workflow for
quite some time, but always stopped because there's already an overabundance of
todo list and productivity software available. I've tried a lot of different
tools for this, but I always end up going back to my combination of a plain text
file and sticky notes.

My main goal in this is to capture the convenience of my current workflow while
leaving behind a lot of the annoying parts of it (such as the wallpaper of
sticky notes covering my desk.)
